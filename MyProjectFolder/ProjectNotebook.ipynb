    "- The user can quit the game anytime by typing 'quit game'. \n",
    "- There are guidelines to guide the user to play the game without any confusions.\n",
    "- The user is not limited to input integers, though only integers could be processed.\n",
    "- When the game is active, the user can type anything without being disrupted by errors run. \n",
    "- The user is able to set a customized range, and a target number between the range will be randomly set. \n",
    "- If the user types a customized maximum that is smaller or equal to the customized minimum set before, the chatbot will alert the user to set a valid maximum. \n",
    "- If the user mistakenly types a string that cannot be transformed to an integer, the game will warn the user to input a valid integer.\n",
    "- The user can view his/her numbers of attempts.\n",
