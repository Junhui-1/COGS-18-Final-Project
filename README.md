# COGS-18-Final-Project
My project is a chatbot called Alva. Users can play the number guessing game or just chat freely with her.



For the chatbot:

- The frame of the chatbot is mainly got from A3.
- The user can type 'guess' to play the number guessing game.
- To quit the chatbot, type 'quit'.


During the guessing game:

- The user can quit the game anytime by typing 'quit game'.
- There are guidelines to guide the user to play the game without any confusions.
- The user is not limited to input integers, though only integers could be processed.
- When the game is active, the user can type anything without being disrupted by errors run.
- The user is able to set a customized range, and a target number between the range will be randomly set.
- If the user types a customized maximum that is smaller or equal to the customized minimum set before, the chatbot will alert the user to set a valid maximum.
- If the user mistakenly types a string that cannot be transformed to an integer, the game will warn the user to input a valid integer.
- The user can view his/her numbers of attempts.

In general, Alva and his number guessing game is user friendly, and I hope the user can enjoy the guessing game!
